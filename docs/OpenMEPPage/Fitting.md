# Duct Fitting

In Autodesk Revit, a duct fitting refers to a building component used in HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems to connect and redirect airflows within a building. A duct fitting is designed to connect different sections of ductwork and to redirect the airflow in different directions, such as changing the duct from a rectangular shape to a round shape or directing the airflow at a specific angle.
